# Heart Disease Prediction App

This repository contains an app for predicting heart disease based on input features such as age, smoking habits, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. The model is trained using a Logistic Regression classifier from `sklearn`, with hyperparameter optimization and experiment tracking via MLflow. The app is built using FastAPI and can be easily dockerized.
